  build after other project build
  build periodically on the basis of crone
  build when a change is pushed to github
  poll scm  we define crone and whenever new source code push it automatically check it

jfrog installation guide line::

now install artificate oss

www.jfrog.com/ + installing artifactory



now create instace of artifactory ::
via using service artifactory start



server.noodle.tetra:8081/artifactory/webapp


now config file ::


artificatory has an avaliblity to intergate with ci cd and jenkins

ci cd with maven::


now comes to pom which is important file to configure jenkins setup

select=> archieve the artificats

now also archieve the artifacts..
 

now save it

now install some of the plugin 
one for copy build artificate
and another war deploymnet plugin

now spencify in second plugin ::
war/ear file **/*
context path:: were your tomcat installed (like loclhost:8080)


now db tool set up via using jenkins::

mvn life cycle:
validate - compile -test -package -verifiy -install -deploy



manage jenkins-> global tool configuration 
set up all maven jdk and git

job change::


jenkins:cofiguration

configurations::
manage plugin -> audit to database plugin search inside plugins.

guide of database migration using ci cd:

 

sqitch file contain some of important files:

deploy(dir)

revert(dir)

verify(dir)

sqtch.conf(file)

sqtch.plan(file)

 

 

sqitch helpfull in case of deployment ,failure ,verify etc

in persistent layering

 

working with jenkins for ci cd::

 

 

now create freestyle project for same

now configure logging ,version repo,build enviroment,build triggers

 

now polling to scm

 

build steps also needs to configure:

 

we can also check build enviroment variables also.

 

now configure repositories and all.

 

some commands for deployement using sqitch

sqitch deploy db:pg:deploy:deploy@192.168.122.15:5435/tetranoodle

 

we can also provide all info in sqitchconfig file

 

now needs of build pipe line plugin

 

in post grep server go to ::

for non secure system go to ::

vi etc/sysconfig/selinux(for disableing selinux disable its only for testing purpose)

 

 

jenkins security::

 

 

manage jenkins ->configure global security->

 

JNLP(java network layer protocol)==>used for connecting slave to master

 

matrix based security is most used security paradigm.

 

 

 

scaling jenkins::

 

one is added in ubuntu another in windows:

jenkins node adding support:

 

go to jenkins website==>donwload jenkins for windows->

 

now in windows: password

 

now in one localhost another in remote location:

 

now connect local with remote host

 

now go to manage jenkins->manage node->now click new node mode

now add permanant connect agent

 

now another windows open::

 

some time jnlp has a problem then we configure for troubleshooting

 

maven

 

global security

global tools configure

 

DSL jobs::

Job dsl plugin

configure plugin

implementing job

run configure job

 

 

variable define::

def var

 

for(0...5)

 

branch looping

when running serveral job parellel

function

 

job('job-name')

 

xml structure

 

 

plugins::

job dsl search

 

creating maven job using dsl

 

jenkins dsl best practice::

create jobs for mulitple branch
