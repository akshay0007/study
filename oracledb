for oracle ranks algo::
Analytics functions::
RANK::
DENSE_RANK::

DENSE_RANK() OVER (EXPR)

SUPPORS we want to calculate on the basis of salary
dense_rank() over (salary)


suppose i want emp getting max salary on first rank and lower salary has in last rank..


DENSE_RANK() OVER (order by sal asc)

how rank function is work::

suppose i write function for getting some info  all emps::

select ename,sal,rank() over (order by sal desc) as rnk from emp;

:in rank function ,suppose we have same salary of two employees 
then rank is same in this case but next person rank has rank of 1+ means, if suppose persons have same salary and have rank of 2 then next person has lower salary must have rank of 4.

but in dense rank case person having lower salary has rank of 3.

rank function basically genrate gaps in b/w.




example:;
sal 	rnk 	drnk
5	1	1
4	2	2
4	2	2
3	4	3	

i want to calculate rank on dept::for that we cannot apply dense to  whole table for that we needs to apply dense function only on dept not whole table for that we needs some understanding.

partitioning the table::
select ename,sal
dense_rank() over(partition by deptno order by sal desc) from rnk;


applying some constraints of alisaing it was not perform like::
select ename,sal
dense_rank() over(partition by deptno order by sal desc) from rnk where rnk <9;

so rnk cannot be refrencing for that purpose we need aligned

selec * from (
select ename,sal
dense_rank() over(partition by deptno order by sal desc) from rnk) where rnk <9;




Partition by::
we can use partitio by clause with over cluse only.

basically partition by clause break up table into no. of partition 
then we applying aggregate ,analysis function on table.

functionname() over(partition by columnname) 

it divide database table into no. of partition 

partitioning and analtics function is used for different find more precious data and if we are applying agggregate function(group by) on table then it actually apply all rules to same column which is associate with aggregate function.


partitioning ::
select deptno,ename,sal,avg(sal) over(partition by deptno) as avgsal from emp;
 

select deptno,ename,sal,avg(sal) over(partition by deptno) as avg,
min(sal) over(partition by deptno) as min 
from emp;


rows and range close is used internally in below script:
select empid,sal,sum(sal) over(order by sal) as total from emp;

empid   sal  total
1	2	2	
2	2	4
3	6	10


if we are not define clause::
rows between unbounded preceding and current row::
basically it showing values of previous and current rows cout

but in case  u want differnet clause for avg ,bcoz in avg values is going to be incorrent due to avg factor of current and previous rows. so for that purpose we required new cluases::


rows betweent unbouded preceding and unbounded following ::
 bcoz in this case windows start from first rows and ends with last row.



select deptno,ename,sal,avg(sal) over(order by deptno rows betweent unbouded preceding and unbounded following	) as avg,
min(sal) over(partition by deptno) as min 
from emp;

rows or range clauses are here::
 range betweent unbouded preceding and unbounded following
 range betweent unbouded preceding and unbounded following
 rows betweent unbouded preceding and unbounded following
 rows betweent unbouded preceding and unbounded following

oracle::
1:select case when null=null then ‘Amit’ Else ‘Pradnya’ from dual;
Answer:

In SQL null value is not equal to itself.So null=null is false and the output of above query is ‘Pradnya’.

2:Following are Set Operators in SQL:

Union
Unionall
Intersect
Minus

3:substring find out
Select Substr(First_name,0,5) from Employee;

4:

Union	Union ALL
1.Union Set operator is used to fetch the records from 2 different tables which eliminates the duplicate records	1.Union all Set operator is used to fetch the records from 2 different tables which does not eliminates the duplicate records


5:
correlated subqueries
Correlated Query is nothing but the subquery whose output is depending on the inner query used in that query.Correlated query is the query which is executed after the outer query is executed.The outer query is always dependent on inner query
Correlated Queries are also called as Synchronized queries…

6:
What is difference between NVL,NVL2 and Nullif?

Answer:

1.NVL :

NVL function substitutes a value when a null value is encountered.

2.NVL2 :

NVL2 substitutes a value when a null value is encountered as well as when a non-null value is encountered.

3.NULLIF:

NULLIF function compares expr1 and expr2. If expr1 and expr2 are equal, the NULLIF function returns NULL. Otherwise, it returns expr1.

7:
What is Index?What is use of index in SQL?
Indexes are used to improve the performance of the query.
n simple words suppose we want to search the topic in to book we go to index page of that book and search the topic which we want.

8::
rank functions::
Dense_rank
Listagg
Lead and Lag
First_Value
Rank
Cube
Rollup
Connect by Prior


over clause::
OVER() is a mandatory key word,it defines the scope of that function, here  '

 means it will look into specifically deptno and partition by clause will do group by on deptno column. I will give some example below ,which will clear your doubt about this.

View	Materialized Views(Snapshots)
1.View is nothing but the logical structure of the table which will retrieve data from 1 or more table.	1.Materialized views(Snapshots) are also logical structure but data is physically stored in database.
