The Java Class Loader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment that dynamically loads Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine.[1] Usually classes are only loaded on demand. The Java run time system does not need to know about files and file systems because of classloaders. Delegation is an important concept to understand when learning about classloaders.
