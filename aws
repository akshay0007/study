RTO(recovery time objective)

RPO(recovery point objective)

 

serveless:: working on services instead of server

 

servel based==>ec2 ,rds,ebs

servel less==>lambda,dyanmo db,s3 glacier,efs

 

 

containers and high avil.

docker not a serveless

 

lambda==>regular,edge etc

 

API gateway::

 

AWS batch

Athene (s3 sql)

 

these inculudes::

Route S3

ELB/ALB

internet gateway

direct connect

 

serverless::

SNS

SQS

 

location zones:: its for elasticity of system

services::

Cloud Front(CDN)

Route53(for dns)

Shield(for security)

WAF(for security)

Lambda

 

AWS Edge location::

EC2==>for cpu utilization

S3==> versioning

 

 

::Tools for monitoring::

AWS console

AWS ClI tools

AWS cloud watch or cloud trail logs

 

::AWS appl level tool

app. level tracing

 

::level of monitoring

by ec2 server

 

::app. utilization patterns.

 

::blue green dep.

 

 

horizontal scaling pattern::

out and in::

 

vertical scaling up and down of server::

 

//must know

settting up aws services ::

AWS conole

AWS CLI

AWS cloudformation==>int. scripting tools with multiple scripts

env.

Aws sdk::

 

HA for S3::

multiple s3 bucket instance copies behind nothing

 

S3 costs::

 

storage classes::

 

 

HA for EC2::

EIP==>n/w

AMI ==>OS

boot time/boot scripting

snapshot /EBS for data

Multiple instance behind ELB/ALB(classic and app. load balancer)

 

Multi AZ first and multi region second

 

how to conn. within VPC

conn. region

conn. acc.

 

elastic ip dynamically change dns ::

 

:::loadbalancing algo::

weighted round robin

latency based

geobased location

 

 

Loading balance service::

ALB(appl. load balancer)

ELB (classic load balancer)

 

 

ECS registry or elastic bean stalk

 

ECS Cluster

 

cloud front cdn

 

elastic cache::

redis ,memcache, elastic

 

 

amazon kinesis:: stream,firehose,analytics

 

its actually based on shard

 

create stream based on shard

 

::amazon no sql dynamoc db

can create scalble table.

 

high avl. senerio::

aws ec2 describe
