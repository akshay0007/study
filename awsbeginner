IAM ==under iam go to user then assing name and access type

aws mgt console access then password.

now it has no access to access s3 bucket so we attach policies with user 
now go to existing policies or custom policies 

now go ahead and create user.

now suppose we have many user : in aws iam so now 

IAM commonly used with ::
users
groups
iam access policies 
roles

NOW assigning policies to muliple users is quite complex so instead of attaching the policiy we could attached with groups.

now first remove policies from users via go to iam ,user and polices

now create group dev and add users into this.

now in iam ==>groups =>name =>skip attaching policies ==>create group

now go to group ==>
go user==>add users==>add click 
now go to permission tabs ==>search for policies (lis amazon full access).

case:: now one of user wants to access different resource of aws 

IAM role:: 

Ec2 :: virtual server

ec2 :now in same group connot give permission of ec2 
now we provide roles for accessing files

(ec2 needs access of s3)
go to iam =>roles=>aws services=>
ec2 =>next =>attached policy (for s3 full policiy)=>ec2 role=>create role

now go to group provide policies of ec2 ,s3, rds

ec2 role for accessing s3 bucket

======================================================
======================================================
AWS network services
N/w configuration :: aws like vpc::

aws global infra:
laltency :: transfering data from one location to another

aws has a region in within region there are availablity zone

vpc basic:: virtual private cloud

private subesection of aws so that you can control resources and control who can access
complete control of n/w


inside n/w : go vpc
subents
route table 
n/w acls
internet gateway

created along with def. vpc

place ec2 instance in one subent ==>like device in your home
network access control list==>acts like a firewall
route table ==>responsible for where to send data
internet gatway==>like as a modern in home n/w public access point for internet

nacl communicate with subnets.


VPC:: private n/w zone 

IGW(ineternet gateways)::
like a modern comm. out side of n/w
combination of s//w and h/w provide access to local to public n/w

without internet gatway vpc having no connectivity with outside world

internet gateway:: IT is horizontally scaled,redundant highly avl vpc component that allow comm. b/w instance in your vpc and the internet


aval. zone inside vpc and internet gateway on above of vpc for comm. purpose

vpc can be attached only on internet gateway at a time

if rds and ec2 instance in same vpc you cannt detach this with internet gateway

Route table::
set of rules called route used to deterimine where n/w traffic is directed

route table associate with vpc


if internet gateway detach with vpc then it show status blackhole

suppose we have detach internet gatway detach then go to route table
routes ::
edit table ::
put entry
dest.ip and target(internet gateway)
suppose we have route table and subnet attached with it so we cannt delete this table


Network Access Control list::
is optional level of security it is used for firewall configureation

go to network acls with in vpc::
go to inbound rules:: into subnets
go to outbound rules:: outside of subenets

rules have numbers
100:: allow
- :: denied

edit rules::
suppose we have two rules with same configures::
then it process rules 

ephirmal ports:: range 1024-65535

now in subnet associations::


create n/w acl:
by default no subnets attached with it.

so for subents click edit. it shows all subnets.


must have gaps b/w rules like 100,110,120

============
network access control list and security group is important common reason for communication b/w aws resources and vpc is not working properly
============

rule with lower number processs first before rule with higer no.

============
SUBNeT CAN be associate only one n/w access point.


Subnets::
a subsection of n/w 

if we created vpc then subnet created suppose we are in north vargina so there are 6 availablity zone , now having 1 subnet with 6 availablity zone

subnet cannot expan more then one availablity zone

a1=suppose we have 1 availablity zone with ec2 instance (public subnet) and rds(private)
a2=suppose we have 1 availablity zone with ec2 instance (public subnet) and rds(private)

a1 and a2 associate with n/w access control list
route table comm. b/w subnets if necess. or outer n/w

in init route table has no subnet attached then we explicity attached with it


so by default we have 6 subentes
so we configure 4 out 6 public  subnet
and 2 to private subnet
====================================================================================
Availablity zones::
avl. zone work with vpc, high avil. and fault tolarance

ec2 instance and rdds db must be placed into vpc subnets
and subnets must placed into aval. zone

vpc place all avl. zone reside and also keep all subnets into avl. zone


high avl. increase resource in avl. zone and increase avl. zone also

suppose ec2 in one subent and anoteher in another subnet due to some failure it switch


replication of data in different avl. zone :: 

fault tolarance::


====================================================================================================================================================================================
aws compute service::
amazon machine images
review of instance type component
ebs volumn basics and snapshot
using security group with ec2
ip addressing
launching and logging into an ec2 instance

computer reside on data center.

amzon ec2 provide scalble computing capcity

black friday in shooping side:: now we need scalablity on holiday load.

temporary holding memory before cpu can process :: ram

firewall ==>help to protect pc

n/w adapter ==>internet or public n/w connectiivty


AMI ==>(amzon machine image)
instance type==> processing power
EBS==>local storage(elastic block storage)
n/w access==>virtual n/w address
security group==>like firewall for communication purpose
ram==>

purchasing options::
on demand:: choose any instance and provision and terminate at any time

expensive options

ec2 in service==>


reserved instance::
purchase an instance at set of time period


spot instance::
bid on an instance type. 
suppose we purchase instance for bid 50 but in provision it go above 50 instance automatically terminated.

sell unused instance

instance type::
genral purpose
compute  optimize
accelerate 
memory
storage


EBS optimize.

ami(amzon machine image)

bundle include os (other apps)

AMI componnet::
root volume templete
launch permission
block device mapping


add in bigger scale ::
by using single node master ami can launch multiple instance


AMI category::
community ami :: free use
go to ec2 service ->launch ec2 instance 

aws market place ami

martet place ami==>bundle with packages


Myami==>

instance type::

family ==>based on memory ,cpu ,gpu type
type==>t2.micro..
vcpu==>...


some of have ebs storeage and some of ssd 
ebs optimization
network performance


EBS::
provide block storage volume.
attached with ec2



IOPS ==>unit of measures
more iops more performance



root vs additonal ebs volumne::
all root volumne can be ebs

add storage via going to servcie ==>ec2==>choose ami ==>add storeage==>delete on termination if check(it will survie in case of instance terminated)==>add ebs to root==>

now in under elastic block storage ==>create volume==>

can be attache with one and detached with

snapshot used for duplicate or backup creation ==> like taking picture of ebs and copy into different ebs

EBS==>ebs is indeipendent of ec2

Security groups:: same as n/w access control list 
they are allowed denied traffic they are found in instance levell not in subnets ..
they are acting likes virtual firewall
when we launch instance they we attached secuitry groups with it that allowed trafiic rules 

n/w access group allowed in subnet level 
++
n/w access have numbers rules in secuity group have no numbers assingn
n/w acces we can create denied rules but in security group has no denied rules


internet gateway ==>elb(load balancer (layer 7 n/w))==>

by default configureation of secuirty gorup:
all inbound rules ::denied
all outbound rules ::allowed


ec2 dashboard ==>go to security groups==>

create security groups:

security groups are statefull 
n/w access control list is state less

security group directly asso. with ec2 instance still go to n/w access control list 

go to add rule:
http::
there is default denied in security groups 
but in nac list we can directly denied rule create


elastic load balancer send some of request to another ec2
security group statefull.


secutity group in instance level but acl in vpc level


IP addressing::
attaching ebs to security groups.

public and private ip address::
for instance provide public ip address.



go to ec2 -->launch instance-->t2micro-->auto assing public ip address-->
it is due to already vpc(default vpc)

another wise create vpc==>
name==>testvpc
cidr block==>10.20.0.0/24
now after create subnet==>
name tag==>test
avl zone
ipv4 block==>10.20.0.0/24(cidr block)


ec2==>ip address=>security group==>n/w acl==>route table==>internet gateway==>internet

lunching ec2 instance::
go to ec2(launch instance)
select an ami
select instance type
configure instance details
  n/w ==>vpc selected here
  subenet-->multiple subnet
running bash script::(add bash)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
servcie httpd start

add storage type

add tages::
key and value
configure security group:

ssh allowed
add rule for http also:
http tcp 80 allow to all

lauch 

create new key pair

key pair name ==>essential key pair==>download key pair

launch instance


connect to from ec2 instance dash board::

chmod -400 assembly.pem

ssh -i dns user@ip

suppose ec2 not communnitcate with internet then go to 

vpc ==>network acl==> click on your acl ==>subnet association 

then check out rules for inboud and outbound rule

firstly outbound rules port 1024-65535 to 1-65535
now still not working
now to check inbound rules ::

click edit
type custom  tcp rule
ports 1-65535


httpd apache service install 
servic httpd start

storage services::
s3::simple block storage service

virtual hardware=>access from anywhere

basic::
primary storeage service
bucket(root/top level folder) 

create bucket::
name ==>unique name
region==>closed to me
versioning==>

object level logging and logs

next(without select)


setting public permission

objects::files

pricing changes on the basis of region

bucket name consist ==>lower letter ,hypen,small char

storage class::
standard

encrtype+n
metadata
tag
name for tracking data


storage classes:
standard
standard and frequent access
one zone frequent access==>
glacier==>long terms archieve(chepest)

chaange storeage class on clicking in object

cost reduction
standard >standard and fre. acc>one zone> glacier


s3 object life cycle::
set of rules migration of objects from one to another storage class

frequently:: standard
non frequent:: standard infrequent
day 90+ not more use:: glacier

lifecycle located at bucket level

lifecycle::

click bucket==>management==>add lifecycle rule==>

configure transacton==>for current==>trans standard after==>30
another transaction ==>transaction to glacier==>90 days

permission::

object versioning::
vesioning on or off


aws database::

security group also provide security to rds as well

ssh tunneling effect db


RDS & Dynamo db::

rds ==>uses rows and columns
nosql==>json (name-value document & no structre data type)

RDS instace classes==>similar to ec2 

proviosing of rds aurora dabase::


rds data base provisoinined into private subnet attached with routing table (no intenret connnection)

ssh tunelling configureing (we have ec2 iinstace via using ssh tunneling can communicate with rds)

configures a private subent grup::
nav. to subnet gorups
create db subnet groups
then setup db

go to rds==>subnet grup==>create subnet gorup(name,vpc,avl. zone(go to service vpc ==>subnet (check subnet avl. zone)),)==>put description ==>create
==>lanuch rds(going to dashboard)


setting ;:
name of db
username
pssword

so secuirty groups rules needs to change::
mysql to allow 3306 port and all ips 0.0.0.0/0

now again go to vpc
network acl ==>inbound + outbound ==>traffic allowed
can check route table also


monitoring alerts and notification service::

SNS==>simple notification service

sns basic==>

atomatically send mail ,text on the basic of some alerts or events
web service ()
sns ==>two clients 1==>publisher(create a topics) 2==>subscriber(receive message like email ,labda,sqs etc)


cloud watch monitor ec2 instace::


componet of sns::

sns max allowed 256 kbbytes

like threasolding for billing and etc.

sns can be imple. via cloud watch


using sns::
add topic::
go sns==>dashboard==>getstarts==>create topic==>name, text message
==>create topic==>create subscrfiptoin==>protocol email,endpint (email)==>

biling alarm.
auto scale set up
biling
to to topic==>click on action ==>subscript to topic==>create subcription 
auto scaling gorup
