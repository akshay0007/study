Recommandation to design rest end points::

:HTTP has verbs (or methods):
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE are the most commo
REST is resource-oriented and a resource is represented by an URI: /newspapers/

Content-Type header too! It must be set to the value application/json


i recommand using plural form in rest end points::
/article/:id/ (singular) or /articles/:id/ (plural)?



Return error details in the response body


Pay attention to status codes

Make use of the status code and only use the response body to provide error details.
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "error": "Expected at least two items in list."
}

GET: 200 OK
POST: 201 Created
PUT: 200 OK
PATCH: 200 OK
DELETE: 204 No Content


Pagination allows users to retrieve fractions of a data set. 

GET: /articles/?page=1&page_size=10


use request params instead of using path variables for clear understanding
GET: /articles/?author_id=12
