1::scm to revision control
2::managed dependencies
 define manifest for application dev

app runing in on linux windows docker cloud foundry etc
3:: application configure::
basic configure for different db and env
 getting configure application
   external service
   env. variable
   user provided service
4:: backing service
 data base connection,cache provide, file shareing sftp amazon s3, (remote services)
build database
stop and switch services
start services
binding your service at runtime rather in compile time make flexible system(cloud computing)
5::ci-cd::
now life cycle
code ->review->build(it is process by framework)->deploy->test
->demo->create stories

build->release->configure
build ->config
  ->releae
run stage
6:: run process
memory specific single threaded
converting lagacy code into it
7:: port binding
in dev we are doing binding manually
enable port binding
8:: scale with process
concurrency in design
increase scalability
service break into different application
horizontal scaleing of process to acheive concu. instead of vertical
9::dispose it all
reasons::: security scalablity crashes happens
enviroment uniformallity
10:use your logs
log as stream
log converter into json is benefical
logging framweork also provide many facilities
12::Adminstration
next steps::
